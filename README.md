#### We have also used Google maps SDK and Places Api
The keys for the same can be generated by visiting :
https://console.cloud.google.com/



#### Implementation of keys in the app 

Once the resources keys have been received , The pusher, cloudinary, places api keys need to be setup with android studio : 
This code snippet can be found in android_app/Project/app/src/main/res/values/secret.xml. You may add respective keys at the mentioned places : 

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<resources>
    
    <string name="cloudinary" >cloudinary://api_key:api_secret@CloudName</string>
    <string name="pusher_key">"PusherKey"</string>
    <string name="pusher_cluster">"PusherCluster"</string>
    <string name="channel_name">"PusherChannelName"</string>
    <string name="event_name">"PusherEventName"</string>
    <string name="event_name_2">"PusherEventName2"</string>
    
</resources>

```

Once the resources maps api key have been received ,it needs to be setup with android studio : 
This code snippet can be found in android_app/Project/app/src/main/res/values/googlemapsapi.xml. You may add respective key at the mentioned place : 
```
<resources>
   
    <string name="google_maps_key" templateMergeStrategy="preserve" translatable="false">MapsApi</string>

**Paid Services which we are using**

1. **API Hosting:**-
This is used to deploy the API to the internet after sufficient testing. After, this the API will available for the android client to use and interact with data.

Currently, a free version of **Heroku**, a hosting service is being used to host the API. This is free for development but is very slow and hence results in app slowdowns.

**Recommended Hosting services for productions:-**
1> Digital Ocean ( Recommended ) - I think we can get sufficient power for this app by using the "Standard Droplet" with 1 Gb memory and 1 vCPU. This would cost around $0.007/hr or $5/month.
2> Heroku - This is the current service we are using, you can upgrade to better. But, this is more costly than Digital Ocean i.e. $7/month.
3> Azure - This is a very popular service for hosting and is as good as, or better, than Digital Ocean but would cost more. It has a huge industrial support system in case something goes wrong.
4> AWS - This is again a very popular service for hosting and is as good as, or better than Digital Ocean but again would cost more since it provides a plethora of services besides web hosting we don't even need.

2. **DB:-**
Currently, for DB we are using **MongoDB Altas** which again provides a free tier with 512MB of storage for development.
Recommended services for this would be:-
1> MongoDB Atlas ( Recommended ) - This the current services we are using and it cheap compared to others and is also very stable.
2> Digital Ocean - This would enable us to have both the DB and API on a single service which might be easier to maintain in future.
3> DocumentDB ( AWS )
4> CosmosDB ( Azure )

3. **Cloud Storage:-**
For this, we have chosen to use **Cloudinary**, a cloud storage solution to store all the images from the product. For the free version should be enough for a small scale app and be easily upgraded to a higher version with more storage.

4.**Mailing Client:-**
For this, we are using **Sendgrid** as the mailing client, this handles all the emails like for registration and forgot password. For this too, I think the Pay as You Go free version is good enough. Then you can upgrade the Sendgrid account to get more emails/month.

5.**Pusher ( Real-Time data service ):-**
This a service which allows us to send and receive data in realtime, this is used to send notifications to the user about requesting a product, if the seller has accepted the request for the product. For this also we can use the **free version only**.
